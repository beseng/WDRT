This directory contains the revised MLER code used in the OMAE paper.  It has been modularized and written in class format in order to simplify usage within the toolbox.  The code is in ./source/, and testrun.m is an example with limited comments.


./original/          -- Data from OMAE for comparison, and some code from OMAE paper --> Do not distribute this, it is a mess and not needed.
./source/            -- Source code
./RAO_data/          -- data for RAO's (generated elsewhere)
./TestData/          -- Output data for testing
testrun.m            -- example code (I wish I had time to document it better)
Movie_Heave.mp4      -- output movie for Heave for quick check (heave optimized)
Movie_Pitch.mp4      -- output movie for Pitch for quick check (positive, heave optimized)
